# BioPyAssistant GUI 🖥️

This directory contains code for implementing graphical user interfaces (GUIs) for the RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) model implemented in the `rag_system` directory. Currently, the GUIs are developed using Streamlit, and there are plans to implement additional interfaces using Gradio.

## Streamlit Interface

The Streamlit interface provides a user-friendly way to interact with the RAG model. Users can input their questions and receive responses generated by the model.

### 🤖 Usage

To run the Streamlit interface, make sure you have activated the Conda environment and set up the Chroma database as described in the main [README](../../README.md).


Run the following command:

```bash
    streamlit run src/gui/streamlit_app.py
```


This will launch the Streamlit app in your browser, where you can start interacting with the RAG model.


### 🌟 Features

🔍 Question Type: Choose between different types of questions, such as inquiries related to the course content or requests for assistance with exercises.

📊 Python Level: Specify your proficiency level in Python, enabling the model to tailor responses accordingly, whether you are a beginner or an advanced learner.

🤖 Model Selection: Select the model you prefer for generating responses. Choose between GPT-3 Turbo or GPT-4 to suit your needs and preferences.

💬 Persistent Chat History: The chat displays the entire conversation and retains past discussions for better responses. This ensures continuity and context in the chat interaction, leading to more meaningful responses.

🔄 Reset Option: There's an option to clear the chat history and start fresh, allowing users to reset the conversation and begin anew. This feature provides flexibility and enables users to restart discussions as needed.


## Gradio Interface (Planned)

Gradio will be implemented to provide an alternative GUI for the RAG model. Gradio offers features such as customizable input and output components, making it suitable for various use cases.


Enjoy using the BioPyAssistant GUI! 🚀

BioPyAssistant is a chatbot designed to assist students from life science curricula with questions related to Python programming.


## Installation

To install BioPyAssistant and its dependencies, run the following commands:

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pierrepo/biopyassistant.
cd biopyassistant
```

Create a Conda environment:

```bash

```


## Usage

### Step 1: Activate the Conda Environment

Activate the Conda environment by running:

```bash
conda activate biopyassistantenv
```

### Step 2: Process the Data

Process the data by running:

```bash
python src/data_processing/markdown_parser.py
```

> Remark: The processed data will be stored in the 'data/processed_python_courses/' directory within the repository.

### Step 3: Create Chroma DB

```bash
python src/database/create_database.py
```

> Remark: The vector database will be created in the 'chroma_db/' directory within the repository (on the disk).
 
### Step 4: Set up OpenAI API key

```text
OPENAI_API_KEY=<your-openai-api-key>
```

> Remark: The `.env` file is ignored by git.


### Step 5: Query the chatbot.

You can query the chatbot using either the command line or the graphical interface:


#### **Command Line** :

Run the following command:

```bash
python src/rag_system/query_chatbot.py "Your question here" [--model "model_name"]
                                                            [--question-type "type"]
                                                            [--python-level "level"] 
                                                            [--include-metadata]
```

#### Customization options:

- ü§ñ Model Selection: Choose between GPT-3 Turbo or GPT-4 to suit your needs and preferences. Default: "gpt-3-turbo".

- üîç Question Type: Specify the type of question. Options: "course" or "exercise". Default: "course".

- üìä Python Level: Specify your proficiency level in Python. Options: "beginner", "intermediate", or "advanced". Default: "intermediate".

- üìù Include Metadata: Include metadata in the response, such as the sources of the answer. By default, metadata is excluded.

#### **Graphical Interface** :

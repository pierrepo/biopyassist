    "In the context of the RAG system, determining the optimal chunk size is crucial yet challenging, as there is no one-size-fits-all solution. Choosing a larger chunk size risks diluting relevant information, potentially leading to less precise similarity scores. Conversely, opting for smaller chunks may risk fragmenting crucial information, resulting in incomplete representations and potentially lower-quality responses. This analysis aims to explore the trade-offs involved in selecting chunk sizes and understand their impact on similarity score distributions. By acknowledging these nuances, we can strive to strike a balance between granularity and coherence in our chunking strategy, ultimately enhancing the effectiveness of the RAG system in providing accurate and informative responses to user queries."
